The workshop will be conducted over two days.

First Day - Installation and REPL

We will go over installation on IDEs and setup of develepment environment on all attendees laptops. We'll use NightCode (https://sekao.net/nightcode) which should work out of the box on most OSes.

Once NightCode is setup, one can download this repository on their machines and open it in NightCode. The directory contains a file called *bridge.clj* which can then be opened up with the *InstaREPL* feature of NightCode. InstaREPL automatically evaluates every expression in the file on the left-hand pane. This file has some very basic opening content that one can evaluate, we'll build upon it as we go through the lessons.

After installation, we will go over the following topics on the first day:
1) What is programming
2) What is Clojure
3) Why did we choose Clojure
4) Taster into a few Clojure things on the InstaREPL
